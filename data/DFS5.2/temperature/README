# To obtain observation data :
# Pre-Req : sosie, data from NSIDC 

1. Run ./get_POLES.bash

it downloads original data, create a mask and run sosie interpolation onto ERAinterim grid

2. Edit get_NSIDC.py to point to directory where NSIDC data is stored then run it ./get_NSIDC.py

it makes the monthly mean for 1979-1998 and rewrites it in a more suitable file
