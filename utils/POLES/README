# To obtain observation data :
# Pre-Req : sosie, data from NSIDC 

1. Run ./get_POLES.bash

it downloads original data, create a mask and run sosie interpolation onto ERAinterim grid

2. Edit get_NSIDC.py to point to directory where NSIDC data is stored then run it ./get_NSIDC.py

it makes the monthly mean for 1979-1998 and rewrites it in a more suitable file

# Data for ERAinterim

Edit compute_monthly_t2_ERAinterim.py to make it point to the ERAinterim directory
then run this script. This computes the monthly interannual mean for t2

# Create the offset file

1. Compile the f2py libs : make

2. Run ./compute_monthly_offset.py

All data files are created in ../../data/DFS5.2/temperature
